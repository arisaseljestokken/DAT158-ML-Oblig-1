# DAT158 Machine learning Oblig 1
This project is a school project for the subject DAT158 Machine learning and algorithms. </br>
The project is an End-to-end machine learning project, which is a part of the curriculum book _Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow_ ðŸ¦Ž

In this project we go through an example project end to end, pretending to be a recently hired data scientist in a real estate company. These are the main steps in the project from start to end:

1. Look at the big picture.
2. Get the data.
3. Discover and visualize the data to gain insights.
4. Prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms.
5. Select a model and train it.
6. Fine-tune your model.
7. Present your solution.
8. Launch, monitor, and maintain your system.

The goal of the project was to work with a machine learning project for the first time, and get to know what tools exists in order to train a great system. We can see that much of the work was done in data preparation step, building monitoring tools, setting up human evaluation pipelines, and automating regular model training.
